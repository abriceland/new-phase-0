Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.


GitHub is a place to store and track multiple versions of important documents and add in only those versions which are double-checked for accuracy.  

After you can an account on GitHub, go to the upper right-hand corner and click on the plus (+) sign

On the pull-down menu, click New Repository

After your username, a form will appear.  

Fill in the name of the new repository.

Choose Public, in order to get help from the widest possible group of people

Click "Initialize this repository with a README"

Click on "Add a license" and choose a license from the drop-down menu

Click the green "Create repository" button at the bottom of the page.

Your repository has been created and assigend an URL.  Find the window that contains the link and right-click to copy it.

Navigate your command line to folder in which you want to place the repository.

Type "git clone " and right-click to paste in the URL.

Hit "enter" and the GitHub repository is successfully cloned to your computer!


Describe what open source means.

Open source means the code for various programs and funtions is published and available for others to use and adapt for their own needs.  


What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

It is clearly a wonderful option to be able to build on the expertise of other programmers vs. having to recreate the wheel.  The existence of Open Source guarantees more creativity and advancement in the programming field.  Of course, code used for programs being sold has to remain proprietary and can not be shared.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

Using licenses protects the copyright of the author/s, while removing the need to administer case-by-case approval of use of any code.  


What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

The process of committing files to GitHub got significantly easier on this challenge.  My mental map of the process also became clearer.  Overall, this was an easy challenge.  


Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I have looked for outside resources on other challenges, but did not need to do so on this one.
