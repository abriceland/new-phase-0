How does tracking and adding changes make developers' lives easier?  It preserves all previous versions of the master and branches, enabling different aspects of the program to be altered simultaneously, while maintaining the integrity of the master.

What is a commit?  A commit is an alteration to a branch that is executed in the two-step add/commit process.


What are the best practices for commit messages?  They should be commands and explain the changes made.

What does the HEAD^ argument mean?  It refers to the last commit that you made and it used to undo previous commits.

What are the 3 stages of a git change and how do you move a file from one stage to the other?  They are tracking changes, making changes and pushing changes.  Files are moved from one stage to the other using the command line and GitHub.

Write a handy cheatsheet of the commands you need to commit your changes.  Already completed while watching the videos and doing the process.

What is a pull request and how do you create and merge one?  A pull request is moving the altered feature branch from a local repo to the origin at GitHub.  Once the branch has been pushed from the local repo, it has to be pulled from the GitHub website and merged either with the branch or the master.

Why are pull requests preferred when working with teams?  It allows programming on different aspects of the code, saves various versions along the way and preserves the working code of the master.


I found this process challenging, due in part to technical issues.  I had problems with connecting to Sublime and then with the permissions on my .git files.  I reached out on Slack and Office Hours for help.  I had to delete everything, redo 1.4 to get set-up and try again.  By the time I tried the second time, I felt frustrated.  I was able to get to a certain point, but then got some much-needed help from a fellow cohort.  As we discussed it and finished up the exercise, I felt much better.  After sleeping on it and reviewing the steps again, I understand the process and now just need chances to practice it.
