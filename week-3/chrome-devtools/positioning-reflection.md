How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

The inspector is a great interface, which makes it very easy to change elements.  It shows exactly the values an element is currently using, so they can be tweaked.  New properties can be added very easily as well.  It certainly makes the process user-friendly.


How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

Adjusing the height and width resized the elements we worked with.  It can also be done by changing the padding.


What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

I am still a bit fuzzy on the differences between them in application, even though I understand the theoretic variations.  Relative reminded me of popup ads that always remain fixed as you scroll up and down.  I need more of a chance to experiment with them, in order to understand how they work.


What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

Padding is directly around the content.  Border is the area around the padding and content combined area.  Margin is the area around the border.


What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

It wasn't that difficult, which was a pleasant change.  But I think it will take time and a lot of experimentation to get a real feel for what each of the properties does and the effect it can have on shapes.  This exercise is merely an introduction to the dev tool and the process.
