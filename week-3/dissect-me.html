    <h2>Programming for everyone</h2>
    <h4>Feb. 15, 2016</h4>
    <p>
        Welcome to my blog! Here, as I trudge through the high mountains and low valleys of learning to code, I will attempt to demystify the bizare and complex world of web programming. You, too, can set the world aflame with code, never fear!
    </p>
    <p>
          This weeks' initiation was into the command line interface (that tiny black box with the power to control much of the world as we know it), git and GitHub. The latter two will be the topics of today's blog.
    </p>
    <p>
          Code has to live somewhere and it is much better to have a safe, warm place where it won't wander off and get lost, as young, naive code is prone to do. GitHub is that safe place, a barricade in the form of an online repository. Git is a rank of guards checking whoever visits and tries to influence the impressionable code. This type of protective tool is called version control. Working code is saved as a "master" using the might of git on GitHub's repository. Branches of the master can be worked on by any number of programmers locally on their own computers at the same time. Once an update or addition to the code is finished, it is sent to GitHub via the all-powerful black box (command line interface) using git. There, each input is saved intact as a version and is compared to the master prior to merging the two files. The guards of git will notice even a minute change when an update is "pushed" to GitHub and create a new version accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the micro-detailed world of coding, this type of version control has crystal-clear advantages. The code is always safe at home and git eyeballs any potential negative influences before irreparable harm can be done. That makes it easy to protect the delicate code and backtrack to a previous version, if there are any unforseen issues with changes. GitHub offers the additional perk of having a large network of programmers willing to check each other's code for error - for free! What better home could a little code have?

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

I used article in this challenge for the first time.  It was apropos for my blog article.  I used nav as a placeholder and have used it before.  It works well for a navigation bar, like the one in my website.  I also used aside in my website for a sidebar.  They are all more descriptive tags that make it much easier to apply CSS.


How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The html tag is the base, the trunk of the tree.  From there, it branches out into head and body.  The head names the site and is for meta-tag purposes.  The body has all page content and branches out into sections, which in HTML5 include more descriptive headings like header, footer, main, nav, aside, article, section, and div.  More specific info like links, lists, paragraphs and images are nested within these larger divisions.


What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I have a Windows machine and after many difficulties, I recently switched over to cloud9.  I followed the process and understand the tremendous help it would be to have chunks of code saved by name to utilize at will, but this sublime function doesn't work for me.  I will have to start my own library of snippets, including those I research online for various ubiquitous problems.  This will save a huge amount of time and effort!
