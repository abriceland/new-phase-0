# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with:]
# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# 1. Solution
# Write your comments on what each thing is doing.
# If you have difficulty, go into IRB and play with the methods.

# Your Refactored Solution

=begin
#Psuedocode:
  1) Create a method that takes a codeed_message string as its argument
  2) reassign the coded message variable with the message all lowercase and split by funky characters into an array of words. 
  3) Placeholder array for decoded_message 
  4) create an array with the range of a-z 
  5) Create an each loop that picks up each word 
    6) Inside that loop, create a placeholder for decoded_word
      7) Create another each loop that goes over each letter in the current word
      8) In this loop, take index of current letter and subtract 4 from index to get the decoded letter
      9) If character is a number, push it in as is (.is_a?(Fixnum))
      9) push the decoded letter in the decoded_word placeholder
      10) Close letter loop
11) outside of the letter loop push decoded_word into decoded_sentence
12) close the word loop 
13) Join the array with spaces (.join)
14) return decoded_sentence
