What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Division in computers is based on integers - round numbers.  If the number returned from a math problem done by a computer program has a decimal behind it, it will be displayed only as the rounded down number without the decimal.  The answer for 18 divided by 4 would be 4, instead of 4.5.
