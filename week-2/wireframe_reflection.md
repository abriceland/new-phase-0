*What is a wireframe?*

It is essentially a rough draft of a website layout with similar shapes standing in place of content, pictures, etc. 


*What are the benefits of wireframing?*

It offers the chance to get a concrete visual of an abstract concept.  With a firm visual, it is much easier to make changes, move things around and improve the overall placement prior to investing in coding that will later need to be changed. 


*Did you enjoy wireframing your site?*

Yes, I did.  I found it to be an enjoyable process overall.  Placing the various elements into a harmonious design was relaxing. 


*Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?*

I stuck with my first basic idea and tweaked it slightly while using a website to create the wireframe.


*What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?*

After viewing various different examples, I didn't have any specific questions.  I did look up websites that offer free wireframe accounts and learned how to navigate around Cacoo to create mine.  


*Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?*

I found this whole challenge enjoyabe and none of it tedious.  The articles were interesting and kept my attention.  I felt confident about using git.  Creating the wireframes was fun and got faster as I went along.  Markdown still feels new, but is getting easier.
