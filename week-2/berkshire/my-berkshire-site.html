<!--
 What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

I found it to be a fascinating problem to break down the elements and structure of the website into code.  Many elements in and of themselves were not that difficult, but putting it together took time and a lot of thought.  Having such a basic site to work on definitely made it much simpler.


- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

This was the most challenging part - to identify the right elements to use and how to apply them in the context of the site.  My partner and I found out a fair bit of new info and that helped to make better choices that those we started out with.  This is an area that I still need to learn more about and see examples of, so I can emulate the best practices.


- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

Keeping to best practices was difficult, because we have so little experience and don't yet know what the best practice actually is.  Even web research can't always clarify that.  We used a validor after finishing the code, which gave us a few warnings and helped us clean up several errors.  I didn't find it to be an issue to ignore the formatting.


- What seems good and bad about HTML?

It is an easy language to learn, logical and straight-forward, from my experience thus far.  I can see that it could be cumbersome in building more complicated aspects of a site.


- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I keep a documents of notes, which I update when I learn new things from research, challenges, etc.  Referring to that is a big help. I also keep in mind that almost every tag has to be opened and closed.  The tags seem relatively logical to me and not that difficult to remember.
