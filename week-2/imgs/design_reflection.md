2.	What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature? 

My site’s primary goal is to introduce myself as a growing developer.  It will feature a blog of what I am in the process of learning and a link to my GitHub account, along with information about my previous work, a brief bio and my contact info.

3.	What are your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience’s interests would mainly be tech-related.  My blog will focus on that and I will include pertinent tech news on the home page, as well.  Those who are interested can follow the link to my GitHub account.

4.	What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.  

Newbies to code will probably be interested in my blog.  They will enjoy reading about someone else struggling to learn like them.  Some of my audience, perhaps the more experienced programmers and potential employers, might want to view some of the code in my GitHub account and use the contact info to reach out to me.  

5.	What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

Websites should be designed to be easy to navigate, while being pleasing and harmonious to the eye. Planning is crucial in design, in order to satisfy the customer and give the user a positive experience on the site.  The planning stage needs to occur before the development stage – knowing the design basics will help when building the site.  Details must be well thought-out from colors to fonts to graphics to whitespace.  A website has to work not only for those with the latest devices, but for everyone, including visitors with slow internet connections and old tablets and phones.  Every website needs to be responsive.  A developer should make intelligent choices to minimize the size of graphic files.  It can make a huge impact on how quickly a site is loaded.  

6.	What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

User experience (UX) design enriches the experience a user has in relation to a product, so that the user is pleased and wants to repeat the experience.  Through analysis, user reactions can be discovered and improvements made, which will increase web traffic and profitability.  Though expensive for small companies, it is an excellent investment for larger companies, in order to ensure the best possible experience for their customers.  

7.	Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I found the reading rather long in this challenge and would have enjoyed seeing more practical applications of the topics.
